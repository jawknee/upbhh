Code for Unplayed By Human Hands to MIDI File Format

An early python "learning" project for me.  This takes
the historical PDP-8 file format from the Unplayed 
by Human Hands project by Prentiss Knowlton, and converts 
the music data to MIDI File Format.

The main module is the uph2mff.py script, the rest are supporting modules.

No .uph content on this repo at this time.
